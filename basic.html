The ghats along the Ganges River were always a highlight, with their vibrant atmosphere and spiritual significance. We enjoyed watching the beautiful sunset over the river and observing the evening aarti ceremonies, which were mesmerizing. These spontaneous outings allowed us to unwind and bond, creating unforgettable memories of our time in Varanasi..</p>
